                            day when you can do just that – with some expert tuition along the way.
                            Singing doesn't require an instrument – it's you! Everyone can do it, so why not
                            come along and have some fun.
                            No music reading skills are needed.</p>
                        <p>The format will be to learn a few songs (popular, folk, classical), with a vocal
                            workshop led by expert tutor Brian McBride to help bring it all together. The theme this
                            time is 'Musical Theatre'. At
                            the end the 'choir' will perform the songs for anyone who wants to come along
                            and listen.</p>
                        <p>This is a community event, so all are welcome at no cost. Bring along friends and
                            family, anyone who is interested to either sing themselves or listen to
                            others.</p>
                        <p>Water will be provided. Bring along any other edibles to keep you going. A pencil
                            might also be handy for taking notes.</p>
