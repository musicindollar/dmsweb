            <p>Music in Dollar (formerly known as Dollar Music Society) has been promoting music and the arts around

                time.</p>

            <h3>Dollar</h3>
            <p>Dollar is a pretty town nestling under the Ochil hills in
                Clackmannanshire, Scotland. Population around 3000.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name Dollar has nothing to do with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar">money or silver</a>!
                It is
                probably derived from the <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts">Pictish</a> word <cite>dol</cite>,
                meaning <i>field</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The town is dominated by two iconic buildings.
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Campbell">Castle Campbell</a>
                sits high above the town at the head of Dollar Glen.
                It was the lowland seat of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Argyll">Duke of Argyll</a>.
                In recent times Dollar has been closely associated with
                <a href="http://dollaracademy.org/">Dollar Academy</a>, with its
                magnificent Greek influenced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Playfair">Playfair</a>
                building.
