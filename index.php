                            Since giving their London debut concert in January 2014 the Pomegranate Piano Trio has
                            quickly established a
                            reputation for fine performances and now pursues a busy concert diary playing imaginative
                            and engaging programmes throughout Britain.
                        </p>
                        <p>The trio's current concert season includes performances of Beethoven's 'Ghost', Rachmaninov
                            Trio Elégiaque No.1 in G minor, Schoenberg's
                            'Verklärte Nacht' and Schubert's Piano Trio in E flat Major.</p>

                                seemed
                                to live inside the legendary world of the piece"</cite>
