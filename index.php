                        <p>There's no better way to feel good than to sing! Music in Dollar has organised a
                            day when you can do just that – with some expert tuition along the way.
                            Singing doesn't require an instrument – it's you! Everyone can do it, so why not
                            come along and have some fun.
                            No music reading skills are needed.</p>
                        <p>The format will be to learn a few songs (popular, folk, classical), with a vocal
                            workshop led by expert tutor Brian McBride to help bring it all together. The theme this
                            time is 'Musical Theatre'. At
                            the end the 'choir' will perform the songs for anyone who wants to come along
                            and listen.</p>
                        <p>This is a community event, so all are welcome at no cost. Bring along friends and
                            family, anyone who is interested to either sing themselves or listen to
                            others.</p>
                        <p>Water will be provided. Bring along any other edibles to keep you going. A pencil
                            might also be handy for taking notes.</p>
                        <p>If you'd like to come along then registering using the button on the left will help us
                            to prepare for the right number of people.</p>
                        <p>Those who don't fancy singing can still enjoy the sounds of those that do. Come
                            along and listen - it's free!</p>

                            and worldwide.
                            They have teamed up to showcase The Story of Jazz, featuring a tour through the highlights
                            of that great and vibrant genre.
                            While they are both virtuoso performers and improvisers, they span a wide range of musical
                            styles and moods.

                        <p>Over the last 50 years Dick has played and recorded with many artists and groups including
                            Swing,
                            The Psychiatrists, John Renbourn, Hebrides Ensemble, Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Michael
                            Marra Band,
                            Chita Rivera and Ken Mathieson's Classic Jazz Orchestra.
