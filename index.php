                            Born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Mario moved to Scotland to study,
                            where was invited to join the Tommy Smith Sextet 'Beasts of Scotland', and the
                            Scottish National Jazz Orchestra. He has played with many of the leading
                            jazz musicians in the UK including Tommy Smith, Carol Kidd and Brian Kellock.

                        <p>
                            Mario is extensively involved with Jazz Education, including workshops about
                            Latin American Music, the NYJO and the Napier Jazz Summer Course.
                        </p>
                        <p>Blending the melodic and rhythmic influences of his Brazilian homeland with an
                            exploratory contemporary jazz sensibility, Mario’s music ranges from luscious
                            ballads to sizzling up-tempo burners. He is joined by Phil Bancroft
                            (saxophone), Kevin MacKenzie (guitar) and Tom Gordon (drums)</p>
